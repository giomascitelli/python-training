You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. 

There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

"""

rooms = {
    'room1': {'name': 'Room 1', 'description': 'This is room 1', 'completed': False},
    'room2': {'name': 'Room 2', 'description': 'This is room 2', 'completed': False},
    'room3': {'name': 'Room 3', 'description': 'This is room 3', 'completed': False}
}
